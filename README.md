## Creation Process  
  
### **1. Strategy**  


- I required an easy-to-read, dependable website that delivers clear information about safeguarding, reporting and meeting times. 
- Location of the meetings and social media links needed to be available.  
- The calm but playful aesthetic is to be carried on throughout the website with the use of consistent, clean design and use of graphics and colour to evoke an emotional and familiar connection for the user.  
- Reporting within the menu page is to be easy access and simple.  
- Mobile responsiveness is an essential feature required for this website.
  

### **2. Scope**  

The Board Game Guardians site must be available on a wide range of devices. The clumb members are a difuse variety of people from the local community. BGG provides a safe, welcoming, fun environment for its members and they wished for this to be reflected in the website.  

- The site is to contain only essential information, presented in a similar fashion and layout.   
- Text must be clear and legible on any sized device to allow the user instant access to the menu, location, and opening times.  
- A brief introduction to the purpose of the club to be included in the landing page.  
- For future development, a list of board games available to be brought to a meeting and a request system. 
  

### **3. Structural**  

It was requested that the design was straightforward, clear and easy to understand with the following features:
 
-A hero section that quicky and clearly describe the purpose of the website.
- Key information sections were to be included with sections explaining safeguarding, signs to watch for and action steps. 
- A bullet list of action steps to ensure clarity.
- A form for contacting and reporting safeguarding concerns. 

  
### **4. Skeleton**  

The site was developed to be straightforward with details about safeguarding and reporting clearly signposted.  

- For the landing page, the logo, Board Game Guardians, was to be top-left of every page.  
- A four-item navigation bar of 'Home', 'Safeguarding', 'Outreach' and 'Contact', is situated always to the right of the logo. An underline feature identifying the current page and whether a cursor or touch was accurate.  Safeguarding has a dropdown menu with 'What is safeguarding', 'How to report' and 'Contact/Report to Us'.
- A large, clear vector image of friends playing a board game dominates the landing page. 
- Centered in the image is a tagline and slogan of the club, clearly explain the club and its purpose.
- Scrolling down the page introduces to slightly more indepth overview of what the club is and what they do. Underneath are information cards with images, a text description and buttons to lead to more information.
- The page ends with the footer with contact details, reporting information and social media links.

- For the contact page, the navigation bar and footer remain as before. Between these lies is a simple form with name, email and message fields with an attractive background.
  
- For the safeguarding page, the navigation and footer remain as before. Two sections are presented with explanatory headings. An optional form for visitors who wish to connect with the business with an interactive Google Map with the business location pinned. There is an option to enlarge the map in a new window and find directions.  
- Below the map again are the location details for the shop with a phone number to contact them.
